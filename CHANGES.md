CHANGES — dashline

Summary of recent work (TypeScript strict sweep, UI UX, Redis cache, CI & smoke tests)

1. TypeScript strict sweep
- Fixed many usages of `any`/`unknown` in non-generated sources under `src/`.
- Key files changed:
  - `src/server/services/cacheService.ts` — narrowed types, added `JsonValue` types, implemented Redis dynamic import with in-memory fallback.
  - `src/server/services/duneService.ts` — normalized thrown errors in retry helper.

2. Loading/Error/Empty UX improvements
- TableCard, MetricCard, ChartCard now consistently support:
  - `loading` (shows skeleton / spinner)
  - `error` (shows error and optional retry UI)
  - `empty` (for chart-specific empty state)
  - `onRetry?: () => void` prop which the dashboard wires to `refetch`.
- Files: `src/components/cards/TableCard.tsx`, `MetricCard.tsx`, `ChartCard.tsx` and wiring in `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`.

3. Redis-backed cache service
- cacheService uses `REDIS_URL` when provided and attempts to dynamically import `ioredis`. If unavailable or fails, falls back to an in-memory Map with TTL cleanup.
- `src/types/ioredis.d.ts` added as a minimal ambient module to avoid type errors when `ioredis` is optional during development.

4. CI, smoke tests, and scripts
- `package.json` includes scripts:
  - `npm run typecheck` — runs `tsc --noEmit`
  - `npm run build` — runs `next build`
  - `npm run smoke` — runs `typecheck` then `build`
- GitHub Actions workflow added to run `npm ci` and `npm run smoke` on pushes/PRs to `main`.

How to reproduce locally

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
npm ci
```

2. Optional: install Redis and set `REDIS_URL` if you want Redis-backed cache

- Example (local Redis running on default port):

```powershell
setx REDIS_URL "redis://127.0.0.1:6379"
# then restart your shell for env to take effect
```

3. Run the smoke check (typecheck + build)

```powershell
npm run smoke
```

Notes and recommendations
- `ioredis` is optional for local development. If you want to always include it in your environments, add it to `dependencies` (it's already in `optionalDependencies` in `package.json`).
- The cache API intentionally stores JSON-serializable values (Type `JsonValue`) — this avoids subtle serialization bugs when persisting complex objects. If you need to store class instances or functions, serialize them before caching.
- Consider adding a couple of unit tests around cache serialization and card error/loading UI states (I can add these in a follow-up).

If you'd like a more formal handoff doc or a PR summary (git diff + checklist), tell me and I will add it.
